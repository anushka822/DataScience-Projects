# Data Science Projects for learning
Hello, 
I'm Anushka, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at UCSC. I created this repository to showcase my personal projects in Data Science, where I apply techniques in Artificial Intellegence, Data Anaylsis, and Machine Learning. 

I'm currently expanding my skills in: 
- **SQL** for data management,
- **Tableau** for data visualization
- Additional **AI and ML** tools.

Thanks for visiting.
